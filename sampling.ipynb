    "\n",
    "As pointed out by Egbert et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316584880), p. 130), estimating sample size is useful for answering two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many units of analysis (e.g. 'texts' or sentences) would be needed to reliably estimate the distribution of a linguistic feature?\n",
    "2. Can an existing corpus be used to estimate the distribution of a linguistic feature?\n",

    "Let's start by answering question #1 by using the sample stored under `mood_sample` to estimate the frequency of linguistic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, let's start by retrieving the linguistic annotations using the indices stored in the DataFrame `mood_sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we convert the columns `doc_ix` and `sent_ix` of the DataFrame into Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the `zip` function to combine these two lists, and iterate over these pairs, which we then use to retrieve items from the list `annotations`.\n",
